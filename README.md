# Overview

A Homecoming: City of Heroes (HC CoH) build planner webapp, written in vanilla JS. Inspired by Mids' Hero Designer and SuckerPunch's Online Planner. This app has no affiliation with the Homecoming team or Mids' Reborn.

# Data Source

With any City of Heroes build tools, keeping up-to-date with game data on powers and enhancements after updates is a challenge. Data for CoH Builder is copied from the Mids' Reborn project; if Mids' Reborn ever ceases to be maintained, there may be a delay for CoH Builder's update until a new data source can be found.
