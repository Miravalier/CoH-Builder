# Overview

A Homecoming: City of Heroes (HC CoH) build planner webapp, written in vanilla JS. Inspired by Mids' Hero Designer and SuckerPunch's Online Planner. This app has no affiliation with the Homecoming team or any data source.

# Data Sources

With any city of heroes build tools, keeping up-to-date with game data on powers and enhancements after updates is a challenge. City of Data v2.0 parses power and enhancement data directly from the game files, and is quick to update for patches. If that tool ever ceases to be maintained, however, there may be a delay for CoH Builder's update until a new data source can be found.

- Image files are pulled from Mids' Reborn: https://midsreborn.com/
- Power and enhancement information are pulled from City of Data v2.0: https://cod.uberguy.net/
